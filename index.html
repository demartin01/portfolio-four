      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="Dec2018.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Denise Martin">

      <p>I'm a New York City native that has gone country. I currently live in Nashville, TN with my husband and our pup. I'm a creative thinker who is passionate about all things people, decor, and dance.</P>
        
        <P>I enjoy community involvement, learning new things, setting goals, and challenging myself. In pursuit of these ideals I have begun the journey of becoming a software engineer.  I am a current student of the Vanderbilt University Coding Bootcamp. The role of a software engineer is ever changing and a perfect encapsulation of each of my passions. I look forward to many more opportunities to make my contributions to the programming/web development communities.</P> 
         
        <p> Please feel free to peruse my portfolio and learn more about my work.</p>
